# Infix to Postfix Converter

# Overview:

The Infix to Postfix Converter is a C++ program designed to convert mathematical expressions from infix notation (where operators are placed between operands, like `A + B`) to postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation), where operators follow their operands (like `AB+`). This conversion facilitates easier evaluation of expressions by eliminating the need for parentheses and operator precedence rules during computation.

The program implements the Shunting Yard algorithm, which efficiently processes the input expression, taking into account operator precedence and parentheses. This makes it a valuable tool for anyone interested in understanding expression parsing or implementing expression evaluation in programming languages.


# Features:

- Converts infix expressions (e.g., `A + B * C`) to postfix notation (e.g., `ABC*+`).
- Handles operator precedence and parentheses.
- User-friendly interface for input and output.
